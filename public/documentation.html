    <p> movies_api is a Rest APi constructed in NODE.js to provide infofrmation
      to the user upon request to the server. The program is written in js, json, and html.
      The aim of this achievemnet is to learn how to use node on serverside development, and to get practive using the
      terminal-->
    </p>
    <p>
      as a server side project, user experience will not be foregrounded, though the aim is of course to be as user
      friendly and accessible as possible.
      the bigger aim is to make the js files as readable and the modules as reusable as possible, so that I and other
      developers
      can understand and reuse the code.-->
